- 👋 Hi, I’m @gagereedrealestate - aka "Gage"

- 🌱 I’m currently learning ... software development. I intend to find ways to create and develop something new, anything I can contribute to, as a way of learning a new path. 
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on ... development of some real estate applications, possible ways to contribute ways to find others housing opportunities so that they can also find a safe space to develop and grow.
